<p class="h2">Capt Empire Industries is a small business which was founded in early 2020 that is based in Jitra, Kedah. This company is owned by Muhammad bin Mohd Idrus, a young entrepreneur born in 2002. We started their business by selling preloved or thrift clothes for those who love to thrift on Instagram, goes by the name @capt.thrift.</p>

<p class="h2">After some months we started the business, we launched their first ever merchandise, the Captain Hoodie, which comes in black and gray color. Our product got a highly positive reaction from the customers. Due to the positive feedback and sales, the company decided to produce more products afterwards. Currently, Capt Empire Industries consists of only four people.</p>

<p class="h2">The vision of this company is to be one of the major local brands in producing high quality streetwear. Our company missions are to provide the premium quality clothing at the best price for our customers and to convince the society that local brands can actually compete with the bigger brands outside Malaysia. Next, the objectives of the company are to encourage people to support local sellers and to motivate local sellers to raise the standard and image of local brands.
